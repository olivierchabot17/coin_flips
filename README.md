# coin_flips
The goal of the game is to flip more heads than the other team. TEAM BIG has more flips per player so it won't be fair to strictly count the total number of heads per player. Instead, we're going to look at the highest proportion of heads flipped per player. The team with the player who has the greatest proportion wins. Which team do you team will win more often? Hit the 'Let it flip!' button to flip the coins and see who wins. You can also run a simulation in the 'Head-to-Head' tab (pun intended) to see who wins more often in the long run.
